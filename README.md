# Direct_sensitivity_method_demonstration_on_benchmark_problems

Implementation of the direct sensitivity method to evaluate the gradient information and solved with fmincon solver in Matlab with the "Simple Reactor Problem". 

The implementation steps are based on the journal paper entitled "Time Scaling Transformation Avoiding Sensitivity Discontinuity for Nonlinear Optimal Control" by Hainan Wang, Xinhong Liu, and Dr. Edward P. Gatzke. 

The "Simple Reactor Problem" is based on the 6.1 Case 1 Simple Batch Reactor problem from Section 6 Csae Studies from the above mentioned paper.
The folder named "N = 3 Approach 1" corresponds to the implementation steps of the Approach 1 in the above mentioned paper.
